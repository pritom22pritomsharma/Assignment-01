                <h2>New Health Policy</h2>
                <p>Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday offered six promises in Punjab – what he referred to
                    as a “health guarantee” – if the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came to power in the state after the next
                    assembly elections. Among his offers were free health benefits at public hospitals across the state,
                    treatment at which he promised would be on par with private healthcare.</p>

                <p>Taking to the streets in protest against the new liquor policy, the Delhi BJP Monday demanded its
                    rollback and alleged that the AAP-led Delhi government has allowed liquor shops in “non-conforming
                    areas”, with some coming up in close vicinity to schools and places of worship.</p>

            <p>The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is sniffing an opportunity to win the Punjab assembly elections slated early
                nextyear thanks to the internal conflicts and bickerings within the ruling Congress.It is likely to
                enter
                into a pre-poll alliance with Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt), the party formed by somerebel senior SAD
                leaders. </p>
